In this game, you have to mimic the random colors/sounds in order. At each level, there is a new color added to the sequence. There might be latency in mobile and desktop safari visits:

Example: 

Game Starts: Red

You have to press: Red

Game Advances: Blue

You have to press: Red - Blue

Game Advances: Green

You have to press: Red - Blue - Green

and so forth. I hope you have fun.
